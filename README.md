# Data Analysis using SQL

## Overview

This SQL project focuses on data cleaning and analysis of an uncleaned laptop price dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various categorical and numerical variables that provide insights into laptop specifications and pricing. By employing SQL techniques, we can transform raw data into a structured and meaningful format, enabling effective analysis.

You can access the Kaggle dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset).


## Dataset

The dataset consists of categorical and numerical variables. Some of them are shown below:

- **Categorical Variables:** 
  - Brand
  - Model Name
  - Screen Resolution
  - Processor Type
  - Operating System

- **Numerical Variables:**
  - Screen Size
  - Memory (RAM)
  - Storage Capacity
  - Price

## Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning:** 
- Identified and rectified inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Modified existing columns such as memory and create new ones to enhance data quality.
- The code for data cleaning is included in the laptops_cleaning file.

2. **Data Analysis:**
- Analyze both categorical and numerical data to derive insight
- Present findings in a concise and understandable format.
- The code for data analysis is included in the laptops_analysis file.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Cleaning with SQL:**
- Cleaned and transformed data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- Added and modified columns to enrich the dataset

2. **Data Analysis:**
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries to summarize key data points.

## Technologies Used
- SQL

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and analysis in deriving meaningful insights from data. By utilizing SQL, I transformed a raw dataset into a valuable resource for understanding laptop pricing
